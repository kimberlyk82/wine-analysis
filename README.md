# Wine Quality Analysis Repository
# About
This is a mini-project about predicting wine quality for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which uses the Red Wine Quality dataset (attached in the repository). 

Table of Contents of the Repository
1. Code for Predicting Wine Quality
2. Dataset Used
3. Presentation Slides

# Problem Definition
- How can we predict whether a wine is good or bad based on its components?
- Aim: To help consumers choose wines of good quality

# Models Used
1. Decision Tree (Classification Tree)
2. Random Forest Model

# Conclusion 
- More important factors that affect wine quality are alcohol and sulphate
- Random Forest Model is more accurate in predicting wine quality as compared to the Decision Tree

# Learning Points
- How to use Random Forest Model
- Difference between random forest and decision trees
- How to apply what we learnt in lab in application-based problems
- How to work as a team! ðŸ˜™
